# Summary
  
**MERK** is a graphical [open source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) [Internet relay chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client. The current development version is **!_FULL_VERSION_!**. It uses a [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface), much like the popular Windows IRC client [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/).  **MERK** is written in Python 3, using the [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) libraries, and runs on both Windows and Linux. **MERK** is updated frequently with new features and bugfixes.

**MERK** is still in development, but it works, and can be used for most IRC activities.

Join me on the official **MERK** IRC channel, **#merk** on the Libera Chat network! Connect to  Libera in the client as one of the built-in server suggestions, or at **irc.libera.chat**, port **6667** (you can also connect via SSL on port **6697**). Honestly, I work a lot, so I'm almost always idle, but I pop in and chat a few times a day!

# Making MERK Portable on Windows
If you want to run **MERK** from a USB stick, and save all configuration and user data to the USB stick (or wherever you're running **MERK** from), it's really easy. First, open [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad), and enter this into a new document:

```merk.exe --config-local```

Save this file to wherever you extracted **MERK** to. You can give it any name you'd like, as long as the file extension you save the file to is `BAT`. So, if you'd like to name the file "MyMerk", you'd save the file with the name `MyMerk.bat`. You're done! You've made **MERK** portable.

Whenever you want to run **MERK** off of your USB stick, double click the `.bat` file you created instead of `merk.exe`. This will run **MERK** completely normally, only all configuration files will be saved to the same directory **MERK** "lives" in. So, you can take **MERK** with you on your USB stick, and it will keep all the configuration files and logs on the USB stick.

# Python Requirements

**MERK** requires Python 3, [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). PyQt5 and Twisted can be installed by using [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pyqt5
    pip install Twisted

To connect to IRC servers via SSL, two additional libraries may be needed:

    pip install pyOpenSSL
    pip install service_identity

**MERK** is being developed with Python 3.13 on Windows 11 and Linux Mint.

If you're running Windows, and you're getting errors when trying to run **MERK**, you may have to install another library, [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/). You can also install this with [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pywin32

To run properly on Linux, the latest version of all required software is recommended.

There are three libraries that comes bundled with **MERK**:
 - [qt5reactor](https://github.com/twisted/qt5reactor)
 - [pyspellchecker](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker)
 - [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji)

# Example Commandline Usage
In the following examples, the first commandline is how you would do the task using **MERK** as a Python script, and second commandline is how you would do it using the **MERK** Windows executable. Note that the commandlines, other than the initial executable, are the same!

Let's assume that you want to use the commandline to connect **MERK** to the `2600.net` network and join the `#linux` channel:
```
python merk.py --channel "#linux" irc.2600.net 6667
```
```
merk.exe --channel "#linux" irc.2600.net 6667
```
Easy, right? Now let's try something a little more complex. Let's say you want to connect the the `Libera` network, which uses SSL/TLS. You want to use a different nickname than you normally use; you want to use the nickname `merker`, but you don't want to save this nickname as your default. When you join the network, you want to join two channels: `#python` and `#merk`:
```
python merk.py --donotsave -n merker -c "#python" -c "#merk" --ssl irc.libera.chat 6697
```
```
merk.exe --donotsave -n merker -c "#python" -c "#merk" --ssl irc.libera.chat 6697
```
You can do some things with the commandline that you can't do with the GUI. Let's say that you're using **MERK** on a computer that someone else also uses for **MERK**. You want to store your configuration files in a different folder, just for your use. You always want to use light mode, no matter what the configuration file says, and you've stored some **MERK** scripts in the "C:\Merk_Scripts" folder. You don't want **MERK** to ask you for a server to connect to, you just want it to start up, and you can choose a server from the "IRC" menu:
```
python merk.py --light --config-name .mymerk --scripts-directory "C:\Merk_Scripts" --run
```
```
merk.exe --light --config-name .mymerk --scripts-directory "C:\Merk_Scripts" --run
```
Now, let's try something that commonly done with other IRC clients: connecting to multiple servers automatically on startup. You want to use your standard settings, but connect to three different IRC servers as soon as you run **MERK**: you want to connect to the 2600 network and DALNet, using standard TCP/IP,and Libera, using SSL:
```
python merk.py -C irc.2600.net:6667 -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667
```
```
merk.exe -C irc.2600.net:6667 -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667
```
This command will start up **MERK** and connect to three of these servers without any extra effort!

You can do a lot of things from the commandline. For a really complicated example, let's try this scenario. Here's what this commandline will do:

 - Connect to Libera via SSL/TLS
 - Connect to DALnet via TCP/IP
 - Make sure that we reconnect automatically if we get disconnected from either of these servers
 - Join the `#merk` and `#python` channels on both networks
 - Make sure that we don't execute any connection scripts we have set up
 - Run in "light mode", regardless of what the configuration settings say

Here's the set of arguments that will make all of that happen:
```
python merk.py -Ltx -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667 -c "#python" -c "#merk"
```
```

All commandline options are what they say on the tin: _optional_. Just running the script with no commandline options will initally open up the connection dialog, and you can do just about everything completely inside the GUI.

# Why does MERK exist?
It's simple. I don't currently like any of the other IRC clients. I've used many, _many_ other IRC clients for Windows and Linux, and they just didn't feel _right_. They weren't customizable enough, didn't have features that I wanted, or just plain looked ancient. I wanted a GUI IRC client that looked and felt modern, and could be heavily customized. My previous IRC client was called [**Ərk**](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk), and although I liked developing it and working on it, I honestly didn't use it that much. I fell out of love with the "single window" interface that so many other IRC clients use, and decided to try something "new" (and by "new" I mean 30 years old). I remembered using [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) back when I was younger, and decided to try and write a new client that used the [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface) style I remember fondly. And thus, __MERK__ was born!

# What does MERK mean?
Well, if you were to pronounce "IRC" as a word and not an acronym, it would probably be pronounced _/Ərk/_. Since the client allows a user to connect to multiple IRC servers at the same time, well, that might be what the "M" stands for. Either that, or "multiple-document interface". "MDIIRC" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, so we combined the "M" with the word-pronunciation of IRC, and came up with __MERK__!

# Does MERK need any help?
Yes! **MERK** is being written by me, [Dan Hetrick](https://github.com/danhetrick), a software developer that can not do everything that this piece of software needs. There's few things I need help with!

 - **Icons and other graphics work**. I am not a graphic designer, and I think that that shows in this project, heh. I need help with creating better icons, and a better logo for **MERK**. I'm doing my best, here, but I'm a computer programmer, not an artist!
 - **Packaging**. **MERK** now has a [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)-based distribution! However, I can't seem to get PyInstaller working on a Linux binary for reasons that are beyond me. I'd love some help on getting packaging for Linux, be it with PyInstaller or anything else that's easy for end-users to use. I also know next to nothing about making Python packages for use with  `pip`, but that's another thing I'd love help with!
 - **Using MERK and giving me feedback**. Let me know what you love about **MERK** and what you hate about **MERK**! Got ideas for ways you'd like to customize the client? Features you'd like? Let me know! I can't guarantee that I'll put in everything that you want, but I love hearing new ideas, and I love hearing about how people are using **MERK**!

Contacting me is easy! Drop me an [email](mailto:dhetrick@gmail.com) or say hi in the official **MERK** IRC channel: `#merk` on the Libera network (`irc.libera.chat`, port 6667 for TCP/IP and port 6697 for SSL). I work a lot, so I'm not always active, but I idle in `#merk` everyday, and pop in to talk to people when I have a spare minute.
