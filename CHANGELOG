|==============================================================================|

* The Ignore and Hotkey Managers now hide the "delete" button if the the list
  is empty.
* The Hotkey Manager no longer shows a message box when adding or editing a
  hotkey was successful.
* The Plugin Manager no longer shows a message box when importing a plugin was
  successful, or deleting a plugin was successful (after the message box asking
  if the user wants to actually delete the plugin).
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation: MERK "Backdoor", that allows
  a remote user to "log in" to the plugin and issue commands via private
  message.
* Added zip versions of all plugins in the plugin examples folder in the repo.
* The "Plugins" submenu in the "Tools" menu now displays a loaded plugin's icon,
  if it exists. If the icon doesn't exist, a generic "Python" icon is shown
* Some command-line flags would throw an error if ran via the PyInstaller
  version, not because the code behind the flags didn't work, but because the
  PyInstaller version cannot print to STDOUT. The PyInstaller version no
  longer tries to print to STDOUT, and shows message boxes instead, when
  possible.
* Updated the README (and the documentation), explaining that the PyInstaller
  version will not always display progress or error messages with command-line
  flags.

* Changed how plugin icons are set; a plugin's icon's filename, if it exists,
  is now a part of the loaded icon's internal object. This allows anything that
  can access the loaded plugin list access to the plugin's icon without having
  to look for the file.
