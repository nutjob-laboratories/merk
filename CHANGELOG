* The Ignore and Hotkey Managers now hide the "delete" button if the the list
  is empty.
* The Hotkey Manager no longer shows a message box when adding or editing a
  hotkey was successful.
* The Plugin Manager no longer shows a message box when importing a plugin was
  successful, or deleting a plugin was successful (after the message box asking
  if the user wants to actually delete the plugin).
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation: MERK "Backdoor", that allows
  a remote user to "log in" to the plugin and issue commands via private
  message.
* Added zip versions of all plugins in the plugin examples folder in the repo.
* The "Plugins" submenu in the "Tools" menu now displays a loaded plugin's icon,
  if it exists. If the icon doesn't exist, a generic "Python" icon is shown
* Some command-line flags would throw an error if ran via the PyInstaller
  version, not because the code behind the flags didn't work, but because the
  PyInstaller version cannot print to STDOUT. The PyInstaller version no
  longer tries to print to STDOUT, and shows message boxes instead, when
  possible.
* Updated the README (and the documentation), explaining that the PyInstaller
  version will not always display progress or error messages with command-line
  flags.
* Fixed a bug with finding plugin files.
* Disabling the Python editor now functions correctly: all Python editor
  windows will be closed, the "create" plugin button in the Plugin Manager
  will be hidden, and both the Plugin Manager and the "Tools" menu will no
  longer be able to edit any installed plugins.
* Added the "overwrite files on plugin import" option to the "Settings"
  dialog.
* Added a new option to en/disable plugin importing.
* The Plugin Manager now shows how much memory an individual plugin is
  consuming.
* The Plugin Manager window now is wider when it launches.
* Revamped the Plugin Manager. All buttons are removed, and everything is
  done through a menu now. The Manager still works the same way, its just a
  change to the GUI.

* Changed how plugin icons are set; a plugin's icon's filename, if it exists,
  is now a part of the loaded icon's internal object. This allows anything that
  can access the loaded plugin list access to the plugin's icon without having
  to look for the file.
* Changed how the Plugin find() method works. It now searches the plugin
  directory, the scripts directory, the configuration directory, and the
  installation directory (if that option is enabled in settings) for files, in
  that order.
* Plugins now have a UUID that is generated at load, and stays the same
  during runtime, even if the plugin is reloaded.
* New Plugin method: id(), that returns the UUID generated for the plugin as
  load.
* Bugfix for several Window methods (max(), maximize(), min(), minimized()
  close(), hide(), show(), and restore()). These should function as expected,
  now.

|                              APPLICATION CHANGES                             |
|==============================================================================|

* Updated documentation to cover all new features and changes.
* Fixed a bug where users with the protected status were being identified as
  being privledged
* Overhauled the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog, and added links to
  the documentation to the "Scripting", "Plugins", and "Advanced" pages.
* Added new feature toggles to the "Settings" menu
* Updated the "Settings" menu screenshot on the repo
* Disabling plugins in the settings menu now closes all Python editor
  windows
* Disabling plugins in the "Settings" dialog now closes all Python
  editor windows
* Disabling scripting in the "Settings" dialog now closes all script editor
  windows
* Fixed a bug where if the scripting engine was disabled while running,
  the "run script" button wouldn't be hidden on server windows
* The "style" and "plugins" directories entries are now hidden in the
  tools menu "directories" submenu if the style editor and plugins
  are disabled, respectively; change has also been made to the systray menu
* Added a new submenu to the tools menu: a list of plugins, allowing
  the user to open the plugin files in the Python editor
* When opening up a file in either the script editor or the Python editor,
  the application will no longer open multiple windows for the same file.
  If the file is already open in an editor, that editor is "shown" and the
  focus is switched to the open editor. This works for plugin files, scripts,
  and connection scripts.
* Added a new submenu in the settings menu: "tools", which allow users to
  toggle various features on and off (like scripting, plugins, etc.)
* Added a new icon for "tools" (for the new settings submenu) and "python"
  (for the new plugin file submenu)
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation
* Added a new command-line flag: -P, --disable-plugins. This flag disables
  plugins and prevents them from loading on startup
* Added a new command-line flag: --uninstall-all. This flag deletes all
  installed plugins, and is primarily meant for recovery if one or more 
  plugins are crashing MERK on load.
* Changed the window titles of the hotkey, ignore, and plugin managers to
  have "manager" in the title
* Changed the "Log Manager" entry in the "Tools" menu to "Logs"
* Log Manager now shows the output on the "Export" tab. This output
  display will update every time a log is selected, and every time
  an export setting is changed.
* Added a "Settings" section to the documentation, covering the settings
  dialog and menu.
* Entries in the Plugin Manager now provide more information than the name
  of the plugin and the version. Each entry shows the name, version, class
  name, file name, author, and size in memory of each plugin. Other than
  that, it works identically.
* Entries in the Hotkey Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  new Plugin Manager.
* Entries in the Ignore Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  other managers.
* The "no [WHATEVER ITEMS]" entry in all Hotkey, Plugin, and Ignore
  Managers are no longer selectable.
* Hotkeys are now saved to the configuration file automatically whenever
  they are added or removed. The "disk" button has been removed from
  the Hotkey Manager, and the "/bind save" command has been removed.
* Changed the documentation title (and the link to the documentation
  in the application) to reflect the document's actual filename.
* Removed the status bar from the Hotkey Manager; errors in adding or
  editing hotkeys are now reported to the user via messages boxes.
* Removed the status bar from the Ignore Manager, to match the other
  managers.
* Status messages in the Hotkey and Ignore managers are now relayed
  via message boxes, much like the Plugin Manager.
* Plugins can now have icons. If a PNG file is in the plugins directory
  with the same name as a plugin (example: plugin is named "example.py",
  and the PNG is named "example.png"), this PNG will be used as the
  plugin's icon, and will be displayed in the Plugin Manager. Icons are
  rendered at 32x32 pixels.
* Plugins can now be imported in ZIP files. Only PY and PNG files in the
  ZIP file are extracted into the plugins directory. Importing a zip
  file will not overwrite existing files with the same filename.
* Plugins in the form of a single Python file are now COPIED into the
  plugin directory rather than being MOVED.
* Fixed a bug in measuring the size of plugins in memory; attempting to
  measure the memory size of a plugin, in certain circumstances, could
  crash the client, but only while operating in PyInstaller. This
  feature has been removed, as its only use was to display to the user
  how much memory the plugin consumed.
* Added a new option to toggle whether to overwrite files when
  importing plugins. At the moment, only added to the configuration
  file. Set to "false" by default.
* The Plugin Manager can now export plugins to a ZIP archive. This will
  package a plugin file (and its icon, if it exists) into a ZIP output
  file selected by the user.
* Fixed a bug with eliding very long nicknames. If nicknames were greater
  than the nick pad length by a significant margin, they would occasionally
  be incorrectly elided, with the nickname being split up over two lines.
* Removed the "import" icon from the resource file, and now use th "open
  file" icon for the "import file" button in the Plugin Manager.
* Both the "export plugin" button and "remove plugin" buttons are now
  hidden in the Plugin Manager if there are no loaded plugins.
* Tweaks to the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog
* Change to the wording of the "Plugins" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Clarified how hotkeys are used (and saved/loaded) in the documentation
* Changed to the wording of the "Hotkeys" entry in the "Tools" menu

* Fixed a bug in the title() plugin Window class method; window titles
  were not being set (or returned) properly
* Fixed a bug where using the plugin Window class methods bind() and unbind()
  did not save hotkeys to the configuration file.
* Fixed a bug in the private() built-in Plugin method.
* New plugin Window class method: active(). This returns a boolean; True if
  the window is currently active, and False if not
* New plugin Window class method: position(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's X value, the second value in the list
  is the window's Y value. If the position cannot be determined, both
  values will be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: size(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's width, the second value in the list is
  the window's height. If the size cannot be determinied, both values will
  be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: history(). This returns a list of strings
  representing the command history of a window's text input widget, in order
  of most recent to least recent. The maximum size of this list is, by
  default, 20 entries, unless changed in the settings dialog or with /config.
  If command history is turned off, this will return an empty list.
* New plugin Window class method: chat(). This returns a list of lists of
  strings representing the chat currently being displayed in the window. If
  the window is a server window, or there is no chat being displayed, this
  will return an empty list.
* New Plugin method: emojize(). This takes a string, converts and emoji
  shortcodes in it into emojis, and returns the altered string.
* Changes to the private() Plugin method: a new optional argument, a
  boolean, can be passed to the method. If the boolean is set to "true",
  then a private window will be created if none is found.
* New Plugin method: move(). This moves the main application window to a
  set location; if the new location would place the window somplace it can
  not be interacted with, the move fails. Returns "true" if the move is
  successful, and "false" if not.
* New Plugin method: resize(). This resizes the main application window.
