| APPLICATION CHANGES |
|=====================|

* Updated documentation to cover all new features and changes.
* Tweaks to the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog
* Change to the wording of the "Plugins" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Clarified how hotkeys are used (and saved/loaded) in the documentation
* Changed to the wording of the "Hotkeys" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Fixed a bug where users with the protected status were being identified as
  being privledged
* Added new feature toggles to the settings menu
* Updated the "Settings" menu screenshot on the repo
* Disabling plugins in the settings menu now closes all Python editor
  windows
* Disabling plugins in the "Settings" dialog now closes all Python
  editor windows
* Disabling scripting in the "Settings" dialog now closes all script editor
  windows
* Fixed a bug where if the scripting engine was disabled while running,
  the "run script" button wouldn't be hidden on server windows
* The "style" and "plugins" directories entries are now hidden in the
  tools menu "directories" submenu if the style editor and plugins
  are disabled, respectively; change has also been made to the systray menu
* Added a new submenu to the tools menu: a list of plugins, allowing
  the user to open the plugin files in the Python editor
* When opening up a file in either the script editor or the Python editor,
  the application will no longer open multiple windows for the same file.
  If the file is already open in an editor, that editor is "shown" and the
  focus is switched to the open editor. This works for plugin files, scripts,
  and connection scripts.
* Added a new icon for "tools" (for the new settings submenu) and "python"
  (for the new plugin file submenu)
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation
* Added a new command-line flag: -P, --disable-plugins. This flag disables
  plugins and prevents them from loading on startup
* Added a new command-line flag: --uninstall-all. This flag deletes all
  installed plugins, and is primarily meant for recovery if one or more 
  plugins are crashing MERK on load.
* Changed the window titles of the hotkey, ignore, and plugin managers to
  have "manager" in the title
* Changed the "Log Manager" entry in the "Tools" menu to "Logs"
* Log Manager now shows the output on the "Export" tab. This output
  display will update every time a log is selected, and every time
  an export setting is changed.
* Added a "Settings" section to the documentation, covering the settings
  dialog and menu.
* Entries in the Plugin Manager now provide more information than the name
  of the plugin and the version. Each entry shows the name, version, class
  name, file name, author, and size in memory of each plugin. Other than
  that, it works identically.
* Entries in the Hotkey Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  new Plugin Manager.
* Entries in the Ignore Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  other managers.
* The "no [WHATEVER ITEMS]" entry in all Hotkey, Plugin, and Ignore
  Managers are no longer selectable.
* Hotkeys are now saved to the configuration file automatically whenever
  they are added or removed. The "disk" button has been removed from
  the hotkey manager, and the "/bind save" command has been removed.
* Changed the documentation title (and the link to the documentation
  in the application) to reflect the document's actual filename.

| PLUGIN API CHANGES |
|====================|

* Fixed a bug in the title() plugin Window class method; window titles
  were not being set (or returned) properly
* New plugin Window class method: active(). This returns a boolean; True if
  the window is currently active, and False if not
* New plugin Window class method: position(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's X value, the second value in the list
  is the window's Y value. If the position cannot be determined, both
  values will be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: size(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's width, the second value in the list is
  the window's height. If the size cannot be determinied, both values will
  be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: history(). This returns a list of strings
  representing the command history of a window's text input widget, in order
  of most recent to least recent. The maximum size of this list is, by
  default, 20 entries, unless changed in the settings dialog or with /config.
  If command history is turned off, this will return an empty list.
* New plugin Window class method: chat(). This returns a list of lists of
  strings representing the chat currently being displayed in the window. If
  the window is a server window, or there is no chat being displayed, this
  will return an empty list.
