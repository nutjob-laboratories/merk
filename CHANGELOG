* Started changelog
* Tweaks to the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog
* Change to the wording of the "Plugins" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Clarified how hotkeys are used (and saved/loaded) in the documentation
* Changed to the wording of the "Hotkeys" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Fixed a bug where users with the protected status were being identified as
  being privledged
* Added new feature toggles to the settings menu
* Updated the "Settings" menu screenshot on the repo
* Disabling plugins in the settings menu now closes all Python editor
  windows
* Disabling plugins in the "Settings" dialog now closses all Python
  editor windows
* Fixed a bug where if the scripting engine was disabled while running,
  the "run script" button wouldn't be hidden on server windows
* The "style" and "plugins" directories entries are now hidden in the
  tools menu "directories" submenu if the style editor and plugins
  are disabled, respectively; change has also been made to the systray menu
* Added a new submenu to the tools menu: a list of plugin files, allowing
  the user to open the files in the Python editor
* When opening up a file in either the script editor or the Python editor,
  the application will no longer open multiple windows for the same file.
  If the file is already open in an editor, that editor is "shown" and the
  focus is switched to the open editor. This works for plugin files, scripts,
  and connection scripts.
* Added a new icon for "tools" (for the new settings submenu) and "python"
  (for the new plugin file submenu)
* New plugin Window class method: active(). This returns a boolean; True if
  the window is currently active, and False if not
