|==============================================================================|

* The settings dialog has been revamped.
* The plugin loading mechanism now tries to catch errors that arise while
  creating an instance of the plugin, and inform the user rather than crash the
  client.
* Bugfix: the plugin manager now reports the correct number of additional
  methods a plugin has.
* New feature: inject IRC colors into input. Both fore- and background colors
  can be set. <NUMBER to start a color block with only a foreground color, 
  or <NUMBER,NUMBER to start a color block with both foreground and background
  colors. Close color blocks with >. Just like with the markdown formatting
  injection feature, this can be turned off by the user.
* Color and markdown formatting input have been added to the documentation.
* Bugfix: entries in the menubar no longer get stuck on bold (if that option
  is turned on).
* Rewrote the "strip IRC color and formatting" algorithm to use some simple
  regexes rather than a bunch of replace() calls.
* Removed the ability to set/change the "erroneous nickname" setting from the
  settings dialog. The setting still exists, and can be changed by using the
  /config command or editing the configuration file.
* The text renderer now checks if text has a URL in it before trying to render
  URL links.
* Rewrote the text renderer's template and style system to make it a little
  more readable and efficient.
* New command: /browser, which opens a URL in the default browser.
* Tweak to the Python editor syntax highlighting; Plugin inherited methods now
  no longer need the 'self' identifier to be highlighted.
* Removed a now-unneeded dialog from the settings dialog.
* Bugfix: autoindentation in the Python editor no longer inserts extra levels
  of indentation occasionally.
* Bugfix: markdown input can now be escaped with \.
* Bugfix: markdown input no longer prevents link creation from some URLs.
* Added a link to the ASCIImoji website to the systray right-click menu, in the
  "Links" submenu.
* Added new built-in aliases: $_DLOGS, $_DPLUGINS, $_DSCRIPTS, $_DSETTTINGS,
  and $_DSTYLES. These contain the paths to each of MERK's different config/
  file directories.
* New command: /folder, which opens one or more paths in the default file
  manager.
* Added the option to disable the /browser command to the settings manager and
  the configuration file.
* Bugfix: when a connection fails or is lost, the client associated with that
  connection is now completely removed from the internal connection list.
* Bugfix: sudden disconnection from a server could cause a crash.
* Bugfix: if a reconnection fails without registration more than once, the user
  is notified about whether they want to keep attempting reconnects.
  Previously, this would result in a "spiral", where the client would keep
  trying to reconnect indefinitely.
* Bugfix: fixed the "Copy link location" entry in chat and server window
  context menus.
* The topic display in channel windows now displays IRC colors. If markdown
  and/or IRC color input is turned on, that can be used in the channel topic
  editor
* If IRC color display is turned off, IRC colors will not be displayed in the
  channel topic display.
* Removed the option to toggle IRC colors from the settings menu. The toggle
  is now only in the settings dialog.

|==============================================================================|

* Bugfix: alias interpolation is handled before shortcode injection in inherited
  messaging methods due to sometimes unexpected behavior.
* New inherited method: color(), which takes a string with MERK IRC color tags
  and returns a string with the appropriate IRC color codes inserted into it.
* New inherited method: markdown(), which takes a string with MERK markdown
  formatting and returns a string with the appropriate IRC formatting codes
  inserted into it.
* New inherited method: strip(), which strips all IRC color and formatting
  codes from a string and returns the result.
* New inherited method: colored(), which returns True if a string contains IRC
  color/formatting codes, and False if not.
* New inherited method: browser(), which opens a URL in the default browser.
* New inherited method: folder(), which opens a directory in the default file
  manager.
* New inherited method: current(), which returns a MERK Window object for the
  currently active chat window, or None if the currently active window is not a
  chat window.
* New plugin event: uptime(), which triggers once a second for every server,
  channel, or private chat window while they are connected to a server.

|==============================================================================|

* Bugfix: script filename autocomplete worked even if scripting was
  disabled.
* Changed the name of the configuration file setting for autocompleting file-
  names for /edit, /script, and /python commands to "autocomplete_filenames"
  to reflect its current usage.
* Bugfix: user information was being saved *while* checking for its
  validity in the connection dialog.
* Changed how the connection history is written. Now, connections are only
  written to the history in the user config file when a connection has been
  successfully completed (that is, registration has finished successfully).
* Connection history now respects the "--donotsave" command-line flag.
* "--donotsave" only sets the default for the connection dialog. If the option
  to save to the user config is turned on in the connection dialog, that will
  be the new default while the app is running. This option is not saved to the
  config file.
* New option: toggle saving connection history to the user file.
* Bugfix: in the log manager, doing a search from the tab bar now switches
  to the log viewer tab when activated.
* Added a setting to the config file that sets the "name" of networks on IRC
  servers that aren't on a network; by default, this is set to "Unknown".
  This setting is not settable in the settings dialog, but can be changed with
  the /config command or by editing the config file manually.
* Bugfix: removed a duplicate call to QApplication() from merk.py. This was
  preventing the initial connection dialog from being shown on some 32-bit
  Linux installs.
* Tweak to merk.py to show the proper executable name in the --help display,
  depending on platform.
* All windows associated with a given connection are hidden before closing when
  that connection is disconnected.
* The windowbar now correctly hides windows for connections in the process of
  disconnecting.
* New option: display channel topic in the tooltip for channel entries in the
  windowbar. Disabled by default.
* Bugfix: the application title will now no longer change for subwindows that
  are not visible or are in the process of disconnecting from the server. The
  application title will show the "default" window title in both of those
  cases.
* Bugfix: fixed the application title not correctly updating when switching
  from editing a connection script to a user script.
* Changed the internal and config file name of the "display active subwindow
  in application title" setting to reflect how the setting actually works.
* ALL script error messages now show the name of the file the error occurred
  in, not just errors in script-only commands. If the error occurred in a
  connection script, the filename is set to SERVER:PORT, and if the filename
  is not known or does not exist, it is set to 'script'. The base filename of
  the script is used (without the path).
* Added a setting to toggle re-execution of plugin init() events on plugin
  reload.
* The default setting to auto-reload plugins on Python editor close has been
  changed from "true" to "false". Users can still change this setting. The
  name for this setting has been changed in the configuration file to make
  sure that this setting is changed for all users going forward.
* Clicking "apply" on the settings dialog no longer reloads plugins.
* Bugfix: an error encountered while loading plugins stop any plugins from
  loading. Plugin load errors are now handled properly, and any plugins NOT
  showing errors will load fully.
* Added a setting to toggle whether plugins are automatically reloaded when a
  plugin is uninstalled with the plugin manager.
* New command: /unmacro, which removes macros from memory.
* Bugfix: the "bold on hover" effect no longer "gets stuck" on the menu- and
  windowbar.
* Updated icons in the "Insert" menu in the Python editor.
* Bugfix: fixed errors with the /macro command's error reporting.
* Bugfix: the plugin manager could throw an error when trying to update a
  plugin console while it's open.
* Bugfix: the plugin console identifier in the plugin manager was not being
  set from the config file properly.
* The "icon" emoji that is used to signify a plugin's console is open in the
  plugin manager was changed to one that is more universal across platforms.
* Added an option (disabled by default) to show a plugin's console as soon as
  it is created for the first time.
* Added an option to the plugin manager to show/hide plugin consoles to the
  right click menu on plugin entries.
* Bugfix: plugin consoles would not be able to be shown from the plugin manager
  right click menu when the Python editor was disabled. This no longer occurs.
* Bugfix: mIRC colors now work properly, and "close" text formatting properly.
* Bugfix: disconnecting from all servers closed or hid ALL subwindows, even
  those not involved with network activity.
* Moved the cursor settings from the "Input" section of the settings dialog to
  the "Miscellaneous" section of the dialog.
* New feature: use markdown to format input text. Supported markdown "tags" are
  italic, bold, strikethrough, and underline. Only displayed in the client if
  IRC colors are turned on, but the messages will be sent to the server with
  the formatting codes.
* Added "use markdown in input" option to the settings menu and the settings
  dialog.
* Added some of the new settings to the settings menu and windowbar context
  menu.
* New command: /_trace, which executes a TRACE command on the server. This
  command is usually limited to IRCops. All command output is displayed in the
  server window for the server the command was issued on.
* Bugfix: Underscores in command names are now ignored for the purpose of
  sorting the command list with the /help command display. Previously, all the
  commands that started with an underscore were displayed at the very top of
  the command list; all commands are now in alphabetical order, while ignoring
  the underscores in the name of the command.
* Bugfix: /quitall ignored the quit message passed to it in some circumstances.
* Added ASCIImoji (https://asciimoji.com/) support! ASCIImoji shortcodes are in
  the format (text). Autocomplete, syntax highlighting in the text input
  widget, and inserting ASCIImoji shortcodes every place that emoji shortcodes
  could go is supported. Settings specific for emojis have now, in many cases,
  been changed to support both emoji and ASCIImoji shortcodes. Both emoji and
  ASCIImoji shortcodes can be en/disabled separately; one can be used without
  the other. Autocomplete in the settings dialog for away and quit messages has
  been updated to use both types of *mojis.
* Much of the formatting of the settings dialog has been updated.
* The emoji that is used in the plugin manager to show that a plugin's console
  is open or in use can now use an ASCIImoji, instead.
* Changed the URL "detector" in the to be a bit more permissive in the types of
  URLs it detects.
* Bugfix: the link creator in the text renderer now properly creates links that
  might contain leading or trailing punctuation.
* Changed the default quit and away messages to use built-in aliases. The name
  of each setting has been changed in the configuration file so that newer
  installs use the new version.
* Bugfix: if servers did not have a network, channel or private chat subwindows
  could not be created. This has been fixed; the network is now set to the
  default unknown network name (which is "Unknown"). This can be changed in the
  config file or with the /config command.
* Bugfix: autocomplete is now much more forgiving, and will detect (and
  trigger) on input with mixed cases, which it wasn't doing before.
* Bugfix: calling /window without proper arguments both printed an error
  message AND sent the improper line as a message to the current chat. This no
  longer happens.
* Bugfix: "/window uninstall" (called without arguments) now lists the
  installed plugins by both name, version, and filename. The previous display
  only displayed plugins by filename, and incorrectly at that.
* Calling "/window install" (without any other arguments) now displays a usage
  error instead of listing all installed plugins.
* Bugfix: If the "reload after uninstall" setting is turned off, an uninstalled
  plugin is now completely removed from memory without reloading the list, and
  if the plugin manager is opened, the plugin list display is refreshed. Both
  the unload() and uninstall() events are triggered before removal, in that
  order.

|==============================================================================|

* Plugins are now completely removed from memory before being reloaded. This
  behavior can be toggled in the settings dialog, but is turned on by default.
* Plugin init() events are now executed EVERY TIME a plugin is loaded or
  reloaded. The documentation and the plugin skeleton have been updated to
  note this change.
* Re-execution of init() events can be turned off in settings or with the
  /config command.
* New plugin inherited method: unmacro(), which removes a macro from memory,
  much like the /unmacro command.
* New plugin event: uninstall(), which is triggered when the plugin manager or
  the "/window uninstall" command is used to uninstall a plugin. This event
  will NOT be triggered if the plugin is uninstalled via command-line flag.
* The example plugins in the repo have been updated to use the uninstall()
  event.
* New plugin event: unload(), which is triggered when the plugin is unloaded.
  This event is triggered every time the plugin is unloaded, including when
  the plugin list is reloaded (each plugin is unloaded, and then reloaded).
* New plugin inherited method: asciimojize(), which inserts ASCIImojis into
  text with shortcodes.
* Bugfix: plugins can now contain classes that do NOT inherit from Plugin; they
  will not be loaded into memory as a plugin, but can be used by plugins.
* The "window" argument is no longer passed to the "joined" event. Due to a
  race condition, this could cause errors to trigger in certain circumstances.
  The channel's window can still be obtained with the channel() inherited
  method.
* New Plugin inherited methods: connect() (which connects MERK to an IRC server
  WITHOUT executing any existing connection scripts) and xconnect() (which
  connects MERK to an IRC server AND executes any existing connection scripts).

|==============================================================================|

* Fixed a "bug" that caused versions of Python lower than 3.11 (I think) to be
  unable to execute merk.py
* Fixed a bug in the Linux PyInstaller version of the app: the "Directories"
  subdirectory in the "Tools" menu would not open the desired directory in the
  default file manager on this platform; the Python version of the app could
  open these directories in the default file manager, but not the Pyinstaller
  version. This is fixed.
* Added a command-line option to install plugins. Plugins must be ZIP files or
  Python modules, and only Python modules and PNG files will be extracted into
  the plugins directory; MERK script will be extracted into the scripts
  directory. If a Python module is installed, if the icon is in the same 
  directory as the module, it will be installed along with the module. Plugins
  installed with this method will ALWAYS overwrite existing files in the
  plugins or scripts directory.
* The --uninstall-all command-line option has been removed, and replaced with
  the --uninstall option. Call --uninstall without any arguments to see a list
  of installed plugin filenames, pass a filename as an argument to uninstall
  the plugin (and icon), and pass 'all' as an argument to uninstall all plugins.
* Cleaned up some of the HTML in README.html
* New command-line option: --enable-plugins (-E). This enables plugins. If both
  --enable-plugins and --disable-plugins are issued at the same time, an error
  is shown, and MERK will not start.
* Enabling or disabling plugins on the command-line will ALWAYS save to the
  config file, even if --donotsave is enabled. This fixes a bug where if you
  enabled or disabled plugins, and chose not to save settings, plugins would
  not actually be enabled or disabled.
* Logs are now saved in ONLY lowercase letters in the filename.
* Added the "erroneous nickname" default to the settings dialog.
* Removed the option to convert channel names to "links" to channels in chat.
  This was really slowing down chat rendering, and honestly, didn't seem to
  be of much use.
* Moved the option to turn the /call command on and off to the scripting page
  in the Settings dialog.
* Fixed a bug with disabling the /user command in the Settings dialog.
* Shrunk the width of the input options button on chat windows, and fixed a
  bug where the input options button could gain focus.
* Fixed a bug where some non-interactable elements of chat windows could gain
  focus.
* Added two new subcommands to the /windows command: install and uninstall,
  which install and uninstall plugins, respectively. The "install" subcommand
  will NOT overwrite files unless that option is turned on.
* The help menu is now "manually" closed after clicking on the document entries
  in the menu.
* New command: /python, which opens the Python editor. The command is disabled
  if the plugins or the Python editor is disabled.
* Fixed a bug where the Python editor could be opened even if the editor was
  disabled, by clicking on a plugin in the "Tools" menu.
* Fixed a bug where the full height of entries in the menubar was not shown in
  the gui. The menubar's height has now been slightly increased, as has the
  "button" menu entry points.
* The windowbar now has the same height as the menubar.
* The log manager can now be launched from the systray menu for servers that
  don't belong to a network.
* The Python editor's window icon is now the Python icon.
* Changed the Python icon to something more modern.
* Added a windowbar option: flash entry on unread nickname mentions. This is
  turned off by default, and can be set independently of the "flash on unread
  messages" option.
* If "autocomplete script filenames" is turned on, this will now work with
  the /python command for Python plugin files.
* If both the Python editor and the plugin manager are open, the plugin manager
  will reload plugins when the Python editor is closed, but only if the current
  file has been saved. This behavior is turned on by default, but can be turned
  off by the user in the "File" menu. The setting is saved to the config file.
  Plugins will only be reloaded if the saved Python file is in the plugins
  directory, and only if the saved file has the ".py" file extension.
* Plugin events are now wrapped in "try" calls to prevent plugins from crashing
  the client.
* Plugin event execution errors are now displayed in a message box to the user.
  This can be toggled in the settings dialog.
* The "event generators" in the Python editor menu now also create local
  variables for the values passed to the event methods.
* Fixed a bug where scripts execution would halt on script-only command errors,
  regardless if "halt on execution" was turned off.
* Fixed a bug where the "halt" script-only command would not actually halt a
  script if "halt script on error" was turned off.
* Fixed a bug where some entries in the "Help" menu would crash MERK if the
  program was being ran from a directory that was NOT the program installation
  directory.
* Added a server identifier to the "script"  tab in the connection dialog, if
  simplified dialogs are turned on.
* Cleaned up the connection dialog. The tab "labels" (that appeared at the top
  of the tab contents) have been removed, and the spacing of the widgets in the
  layout has been tweaked.
* Drag-and-drop has been added to the main application. Users can drag MERK
  scripts or Python scripts onto the main application window to open up those
  files in editors.
* Plugin ZIP files can now be dragged-and-dropped onto the main application
  window to install them.
* Drag-and-drop can now be turned off in the settings dialog.
* The /help command now shows what "subcommands" for the /window command are
  currently enabled.
* Tweaked the /help command display to fix some typos and formatting errors.
* Added an option (which is turned on by default) that places hotkey, ignore,
  and plugin managers on top of the main window.
* Removed the colons (:) from the text input lables on the connect dialog.
* Scripting threads now have their main execution loop wrapped in a try/except
  statement. Scripts could sometimes exit pre-maturely, and would take down
  the client with it; this should no longer occur.
* Error messages encountered while executing individual lines in scripts should
  be more informative.
* Exiting MERK on Linux no longer causes a segmentation fault/core dump. I'm
  still not exactly sure why this was occuring (I'm assuming because of the
  multi-threaded nature of various features); os._exit() is now used to
  terminate the application upon exit.
* Scripting threads are now closed "properly" before being deleted. This was
  causing race-condition crashing in certain circumstances. The timeout for the
  thread closing is set by default to 1000ms, but can be changed in the config
  file.
* Re-worked the layout of the settings dialog to be more compact.
* New setting: write all script errors to STDOUT. This setting is turned off
  by default, and can be toggled on the "advanced" page in the settings dialog.

|==============================================================================|

* Plugins no longer have to have an event method to be loaded without errors;
  they can have methods executable with the /call command without any event
  methods.
* The "joined" event is now slightly delayed until the channel's userlist is
  fully populated.
* The Twisted client that triggered the event is now passed to the "joined"
  event as an argument.
* Plugin load and refresh mechanism has been streamlined, making loading and
  reloading the full plugin list slightly faster.

|==============================================================================|

* Fixed a bug with MERK exiting cleanly when using the /exit command.
* Changed the layout of the "Logs" and "Plugins" sections of the Settings
  dialog.
* Fixed some of the text on the "Input" section of the Settings dialog.
* Fixed a bug with autoindent in the Python editor.
* The tab key in the Python editor is now overridden if autoindent is turned
  on, and inserts the default indent when pressed.
* The Plugin Manager now generates a README file for exported plugin zips.
* The Plugin Manager now prompts for an icon on export, if the plugin doesn't
  already have one. Selecting an icon is not mandatory for export.
* Added a Linux binary distribution.
* Fixed a bug for IRCds without a "network" attribute set.
* Removed some of the decoration from the systray context menu. It wasn't
  rendering at all under Linux, and honestly, didn't really do much of anything
  except look a little pretty.
* Completely re-wrote the build system for both Windows and Linux.
* Scripting no longer has multi-line comments; they were not very useful, and
  actively interfered with some script-only commands like goto. Now, scripts
  can only comment by using the /rem command.
* Removed the /reclaim command. This functionality can be implemented with
  plugins, now, and do not require a separate, threaded command.
* Removed the /shell command. This functionality can also be implemented with
  plugins (and honestly implemented better).
* Removed the /random command. Again, this can be better implemented with a
  plugin.
* New command: /admin. This requests (and displays) administrative information
  from an IRC server.
* Commands that can only be used by server operators will start with an under-
  score. This is to prevent users from "accidentally" using or autocompleting
  the command, and to distinguish them from normal commands.
* New command: /_die. This tells the server to shut down, and can only be issued
  by server operators.
* New command: /_connect. This tells the server (or another server) to connect
  to a server. Can only be issued by server operators.
* New command: /info. This requests server information from the server.
* New command: /ison. This displays if the nicknames passed to it are currently
  online.
* New command: /_kill. This forcibly removes a client from the IRC network,
  and can only be issued by IRC operators.
* New command: /links. This requests a list of the servers the IRC server is
  connected to.
* New command: /lusers. This requests statistics about the server.
* New command: /_rehash. This causes the server to reprocess and reload
  configuration files, and can only be issued by IRC operators.
* Renamed the /raw command to /quote, to match other IRC clients.
* Added an option to toggle showing LUSERS responses in the current window;
  by default, it is turned off, and will only display in the server window.
* Added an option to toggle showing ISON responses in the current window;
  by default, it is turned off, and will only display in the server window.
* Major bugfix: users can no longer "drag" the view in the input widget, thus
  hiding the text in the input widget. The text input widget will always show
  the single line of input text now, regardless of whether the users drags the
  mouse inside of the widget. This bugfix has also been applied to the text
  entry widgets for the default quit message and default away message in the
  settings dialog.
* Removed the "close" button from the log manager.
* Moved some of the "single line" management code for the text input widget
  into the widget class itself.
* Fixed a bug that only seemed to occur in the Linux Python (non-PyInstaller)
  version of the app: when all visible subwindows were closed, the app would
  hang on closing the last window. This no longer occurs, in any version.
* New command: /wallops. This sends a message to all operators.
* New command: /userhost. This requests information about users from the
  server.
* Moved MansionNET into its proper place in the server list.
* Fixed a bug where there was no fallback nickname if the nickname trying
  to be set failed the server's rules. The fallback nickname ("Guest") is now
  set in the configuration file, under "bad_nickname_fallback".
* Changed how nick collisions are handled: if an alternate nick is not provided
  or is also in use, a random number from between 1 and 999 is selected and
  appended to the nickname and tried. Previously, the random number would be
  from 1 to 99.

|==============================================================================|

* The Window nicks() method no longer returns None.
* The Window users() method no longer returns None.
* Changes to the Window users() method: now, if a string containing a channel
  status is passed as an argument, a list of users in the channel with that
  status is returned, with an empty list being returned if there are no users
  with that status.
* New plugin event: ison(). This triggers when a response to the ISON command
  is received.
* Fixed a bug with the closed() plugin event; the event no longer fires with
  the name of *every* existing window whenever a window closes.

* Updated the documentation to reflect all new changes.
* Changed the "ban" icon.
* Changed the "No users ignored" entry in the Ignore Manager to match the
  "empty list" design of the other managers.
* Changed the "No hotkeys set" entry in the Hotkey Manager to match the other
  Managers.
* Added an "insert" menu to the Python editor; this will insert plugin methods
  into source code, complete with proper indentation. It includes an entry
  to insert methods for use with the /call command.
* Importing a plugin from the Plugin Manager now asks the user if they want to
  overwrite files, and does so if the user wishes. If the option to overwrite
  is turned on, this is done automatically.
* Writing a file to a ZIP with the script editor now overwrites that file if
  the file already exists in the ZIP. This was kind of a bug, but not really?
  Anyway, it's fixed/working as intended.
* Moved the "Insert" menu to being directly after the "Edit" menu in the
  Python editor.
* Added the ability to hide the operating environment (OS, Python version, and
  PyInstaller version) in CTCP VERSION replies.
* Added the option to disable replying to CTCP VERSION requests.
* Added the option to disable replying to CTCP SOURCE requests.
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation; this one uses "urllib"
  from Python's standard library, thus showing how plugins can use Python libs
  on all platforms/distributions.
* Changed the icon for the channel mode menu. The icon the menu uses is now
  the same as the channel operator icon.
* Fixed a bug where the target of a channel ban or unban was not being
  displayed properly.
* Refined how modes being set or unset were displayed to the user; now, more
  information about the mode details are being displayed.
* Tweaked the spacing on a few of the "pages" in the Settings dialog.
* If "always on top" is turned on while running, any of the managers that are
  open will now have the same setting, and will be updated without having
  to close and restart them.
* Added option to en/disable the "double click nick display to change nick"
  dialog to the Settings dialog.
* The "plugin has an open console" marker in the Plugin Manager can now be
  set in the config file.
* The "arguments" argument to the mode() and unmode() Plugin events is now
  always passed as a list of strings, rather than a tuple.
* Mode setting and unsetting messages now always display the target of the
  set or unset in every window the message is displayed in.
* Mode setting and unsetting messages from the server now display the
  hostname (if available; if not, the connecting IP and port), rather than
  stating "Server set...".
* Added an option to the right click menu of a plugin in the Plugin Manager
  to view a plugin's console, if it has one.
* Removed the "Author:" label from plugin items in the Plugin Manager. The
  plugin item still displays the author, it's just no longer labeled.
* Changed plugin tool tips in the Plugin Manager. They no longer show the
  author or URL, and now show the number of methods callable with the /call
  command.
* Extensive tweaks to the layout of the Settings dialog.
* The Plugin Manager no longer displays how much memory a plugin is using.
  This was causing crashing.
* Fixed a bug where the user could set the alias interpolation symbol to
  a blank string in the Settings dialog.
* Fixed a bug with MERK closing. If MERK was closed (via the window controls
  or quitting from the menu) without disconnecting from any servers, MERK
  would just close the client connection, and not send a QUIT command to the
  server. This has been fixed.

* New Plugin event: isupport, which triggers when the server sends the client
  a list of the options the server supports.
* Added a new argument to the activate() Plugin event: "last", a Window class
  for the previously activated window. If the window doesn't exist when the
  event is triggered, "last" is set to "None".
* Changed the plugin icon size to 48x48. All example plugins have been updated
  with new, properly sized icons.
* Plugins no longer count inherited methods towards the plugin's method count.
* Changed the "default" plugin skeleton. A lot of the "cruft" was removed.

|==============================================================================|

* Updated documentation will all changes.
* The Ignore and Hotkey Managers now hide the "delete" button if the list
  is empty.
* The Hotkey Manager no longer shows a message box when adding or editing a
  hotkey was successful.
* The Plugin Manager no longer shows a message box when importing a plugin was
  successful, or deleting a plugin was successful (after the message box asking
  if the user wants to actually delete the plugin).
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation: MERK "Backdoor", that allows
  a remote user to "log in" to the plugin and issue commands via private
  message.
* Added zip versions of all plugins in the plugin examples folder in the repo.
* The "Plugins" submenu in the "Tools" menu now displays a loaded plugin's icon,
  if it exists. If the icon doesn't exist, a generic "Python" icon is shown
* Fixed a bug with finding plugin files.
* Disabling the Python editor now functions correctly: all Python editor
  windows will be closed, the "create" plugin button in the Plugin Manager
  will be hidden, and both the Plugin Manager and the "Tools" menu will no
  longer be able to edit any installed plugins.
* Added the "overwrite files on plugin import" option to the "Settings"
  dialog.
* The Plugin Manager now shows how much memory an individual plugin is
  consuming.
* The Plugin Manager window now is wider when it launches.
* Revamped the Plugin Manager. All buttons are removed, and everything is
  done through menus now. The Manager still works the same way, it's just a
  change to the GUI.
* Bugfix: saving connection scripts in the script editor stopped functioning,
  due to another bugfix having a side effect. This has been fixed, and
  connection script saving works again.
* Added an option to the Python editor to create a new, blank file.
* Added a right click context menu to items in the Plugin Manager; this is
  now how plugins are exported and uninstalled.
* The plugins directory is now accessible from the "Plugins" menu in the
  Plugin Manager.
* Fixed a bug with the distribution build scripts; the "pike" library wasn't
  being included in the source distribution.
* Fixed a bug with trying to check if an input port is a number running
  under PyInstaller for the command-line flag interface.
* Re-worked the command-line help interface. Changed the ASCII logo, and
  the -h/--help flag now shows a message box telling the user to check the
  User Guide for help if running under PyInstaller.
* The PyInstaller version of the app now shows a message box and exits when
  resetting the user and configuration files to defaults.
* With minor differences, the command-line interface of MERK now works
  identically, no matter what platform MERK is being ran on. This change has
  been noted in the documentation.
* Added references to MERK running on macOS to the documentation and the
  README.
* Default indentation for the Python editor can now be set in the config
  file. Editing of this setting with /config has been disabled.
* New "import" and "export" icons for the Plugin Manager.
* Changed the icon for "edit plugin" in the Plugin Manager.
* Double clicking on a plugin in the Plugin Manager now opens up a plugin's
  console (if it exists) instead of editing the plugin.
* To edit a plugin from the Plugin Manager, use the plugin's right click
  menu.
* CHANGELOG has been added to the various distributions, including the
  application installer.
* Changed the filename for the setup archive in the distributions.
* The Plugin Manager now displays if a plugin has an open console or not.
* Removed the "Close" buttons from the Hotkey and Ignore Managers.
* Plugin console windows now appear in the "Windows" menu. The title of the
  entry in the menu is whatever the title of the console window currently is.
* The application now makes sure that it at least *attempts* to close all
  subwindows "manually" on close.
* New command: /call, which allows methods in plugins to be called directly.
  The method must not have the same name as an event or inherited method,
  and only takes two arguments (a Window class, and a list of strings that
  represent the arguments passed to the /call command). The new command takes
  at least one argument, the name of the method, and all other arguments
  are passed to the method. If multiple plugins contain the method named
  in the /call command, they will all be executed.
* Added /call-able methods to input autocomplete.
* Added a new setting: en/disable /call method autocomplete.
* Added a new setting: en/disable /call command
* Fixed a bug with some commands not appearing properly highlighted in the
  script editor.
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation.
* Plugins no longer need a setting to be "true" to import plugins; the
  ability to import plugins is on by default, and cannot be turned off.
* The script editor can now import scripts; users select a MERK script,
  which is then copied into MERK's script directory and opened.
* MERK scripts included in plugin ZIP files can now be automatically
  copied into the scripts directory on plugin install.
* The script editor can now write script files directly into ZIP files,
  allowing the full plugin development cycle to happen inside MERK.
* The scripts directory can now be opened from the script editor.
* The plugins directory can now be opened from the Python editor.

|==============================================================================|

* Changed how plugin icons are set; a plugin's icon's filename, if it exists,
  is now a part of the loaded icon's internal object. This allows anything that
  can access the loaded plugin list access to the plugin's icon without having
  to look for the file.
* Changed how the Plugin find() method works. It now searches the plugin
  directory, the scripts directory, the configuration directory, and the
  installation directory (if that option is enabled in settings) for files, in
  that order.
* Plugins now have a UUID that is generated at load, and stays the same
  during runtime, even if the plugin is reloaded.
* New Plugin method: id(), that returns the UUID generated for the plugin as
  load.
* Bugfix for several Window methods (max(), maximize(), min(), minimized()
  close(), hide(), show(), and restore()). These should function as expected,
  now.
* Plugins now have access to a "console" subwindow to display data to the user.
  Each plugin has their own console, and is created when it is initially
  accessed. When created the console is hidden, and the plugin must use the
  console's show() method to make it visible. The console can display time-
  stamped strings or HTML.  It is accessible programmatically or by double
  clicking a plugin's entry in the Plugin Manager.
* Plugins can now have methods callable by the new /call command.

|==============================================================================|

* Updated documentation to cover all new features and changes.
* Fixed a bug where users with the protected status were being identified as
  being privileged
* Overhauled the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog, and added links to
  the documentation to the "Scripting", "Plugins", and "Advanced" pages.
* Added new feature toggles to the "Settings" menu
* Updated the "Settings" menu screenshot on the repo
* Disabling plugins in the settings menu now closes all Python editor
  windows
* Disabling plugins in the "Settings" dialog now closes all Python
  editor windows
* Disabling scripting in the "Settings" dialog now closes all script editor
  windows
* Fixed a bug where if the scripting engine was disabled while running,
  the "run script" button wouldn't be hidden on server windows
* The "style" and "plugins" directories entries are now hidden in the
  tools menu "directories" submenu if the style editor and plugins
  are disabled, respectively; change has also been made to the systray menu
* Added a new submenu to the tools menu: a list of plugins, allowing
  the user to open the plugin files in the Python editor
* When opening up a file in either the script editor or the Python editor,
  the application will no longer open multiple windows for the same file.
  If the file is already open in an editor, that editor is "shown" and the
  focus is switched to the open editor. This works for plugin files, scripts,
  and connection scripts.
* Added a new submenu in the settings menu: "tools", which allow users to
  toggle various features on and off (like scripting, plugins, etc.)
* Added a new icon for "tools" (for the new settings submenu) and "python"
  (for the new plugin file submenu)
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation
* Added a new command-line flag: -P, --disable-plugins. This flag disables
  plugins and prevents them from loading on startup
* Added a new command-line flag: --uninstall-all. This flag deletes all
  installed plugins, and is primarily meant for recovery if one or more 
  plugins are crashing MERK on load.
* Changed the window titles of the hotkey, ignore, and plugin managers to
  have "manager" in the title
* Changed the "Log Manager" entry in the "Tools" menu to "Logs"
* Log Manager now shows the output on the "Export" tab. This output
  display will update every time a log is selected, and every time
  an export setting is changed.
* Added a "Settings" section to the documentation, covering the settings
  dialog and menu.
* Entries in the Plugin Manager now provide more information than the name
  of the plugin and the version. Each entry shows the name, version, class
  name, file name, author, and size in memory of each plugin. Other than
  that, it works identically.
* Entries in the Hotkey Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  new Plugin Manager.
* Entries in the Ignore Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  other managers.
* The "no [WHATEVER ITEMS]" entry in all Hotkey, Plugin, and Ignore
  Managers are no longer selectable.
* Hotkeys are now saved to the configuration file automatically whenever
  they are added or removed. The "disk" button has been removed from
  the Hotkey Manager, and the "/bind save" command has been removed.
* Changed the documentation title (and the link to the documentation
  in the application) to reflect the document's actual filename.
* Removed the status bar from the Hotkey Manager; errors in adding or
  editing hotkeys are now reported to the user via messages boxes.
* Removed the status bar from the Ignore Manager, to match the other
  managers.
* Status messages in the Hotkey and Ignore managers are now relayed
  via message boxes, much like the Plugin Manager.
* Plugins can now have icons. If a PNG file is in the plugins directory
  with the same name as a plugin (example: plugin is named "example.py",
  and the PNG is named "example.png"), this PNG will be used as the
  plugin's icon, and will be displayed in the Plugin Manager. Icons are
  rendered at 32x32 pixels.
* Plugins can now be imported in ZIP files. Only PY and PNG files in the
  ZIP file are extracted into the plugins directory. Importing a zip
  file will not overwrite existing files with the same filename.
* Plugins in the form of a single Python file are now COPIED into the
  plugin directory rather than being MOVED.
* Fixed a bug in measuring the size of plugins in memory; attempting to
  measure the memory size of a plugin, in certain circumstances, could
  crash the client, but only while operating in PyInstaller. This
  feature has been removed, as its only use was to display to the user
  how much memory the plugin consumed.
* Added a new option to toggle whether to overwrite files when
  importing plugins. At the moment, only added to the configuration
  file. Set to "false" by default.
* The Plugin Manager can now export plugins to a ZIP archive. This will
  package a plugin file (and its icon, if it exists) into a ZIP output
  file selected by the user.
* Fixed a bug with eliding very long nicknames. If nicknames were greater
  than the nick pad length by a significant margin, they would occasionally
  be incorrectly elided, with the nickname being split up over two lines.
* Removed the "import" icon from the resource file, and now use the "open
  file" icon for the "import file" button in the Plugin Manager.
* Both the "export plugin" button and "remove plugin" buttons are now
  hidden in the Plugin Manager if there are no loaded plugins.
* Tweaks to the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog
* Change to the wording of the "Plugins" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Clarified how hotkeys are used (and saved/loaded) in the documentation
* Changed to the wording of the "Hotkeys" entry in the "Tools" menu

|==============================================================================|

* Fixed a bug in the title() plugin Window class method; window titles
  were not being set (or returned) properly
* Fixed a bug where using the plugin Window class methods bind() and unbind()
  did not save hotkeys to the configuration file.
* Fixed a bug in the private() built-in Plugin method.
* New plugin Window class method: active(). This returns a boolean; True if
  the window is currently active, and False if not
* New plugin Window class method: position(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's X value, the second value in the list
  is the window's Y value. If the position cannot be determined, both
  values will be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: size(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's width, the second value in the list is
  the window's height. If the size cannot be determined, both values will
  be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: history(). This returns a list of strings
  representing the command history of a window's text input widget, in order
  of most recent to least recent. The maximum size of this list is, by
  default, 20 entries, unless changed in the settings dialog or with /config.
  If command history is turned off, this will return an empty list.
* New plugin Window class method: chat(). This returns a list of lists of
  strings representing the chat currently being displayed in the window. If
  the window is a server window, or there is no chat being displayed, this
  will return an empty list.
* New Plugin method: emojize(). This takes a string, converts and emoji
  shortcodes in it into emojis, and returns the altered string.
* Changes to the private() Plugin method: a new optional argument, a
  boolean, can be passed to the method. If the boolean is set to "true",
  then a private window will be created if none is found.
* New Plugin method: move(). This moves the main application window to a
  set location; if the new location would place the window someplace it can
  not be interacted with, the move fails. Returns "true" if the move is
  successful, and "false" if not.
* New Plugin method: resize(). This resizes the main application window.
