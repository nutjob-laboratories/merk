|==============================================================================|

* Fixed a bug with MERK exiting cleanly when using the /exit command.
* Changed the layout of the "Logs" and "Plugins" sections of the Settings
  dialog.
* Fixed some of the text on the "Input" section of the Settings dialog.
* Fixed a bug with autoindent in the Python editor.
* The tab key in the Python editor is now overridden if autoindent is turned
  on, and inserts the default indent when pressed.
* The Plugin Manager now generates a README file for exported plugin zips.
* The Plugin Manager now prompts for an icon on export, if the plugin doesn't
  already have one. Selecting an icon is not mandatory for export.
* Added a Linux binary distribution.
* Fixed a bug with IRCd's without a "network" attribute set.
* Removed some of the decoration from the systray context menu. It wasn't
  rendering at all under Linux, and honestly, didn't really do much of anything
  except look a little pretty.
* Completely re-wrote the build system for both Windows and Linux.
* Scripting no longer has multi-line comments; they were not very useful, and
  actively interfered with some script-only commands like goto. Now, scripts
  can only comment by using the /rem command.
* Removed the /reclaim command. This functionality can be implemented with
  plugins, now, and do not require a separate, threaded command.
* Removed the /shell command. This functionality can also be implemented with
  plugins (and honestly implemented better).
* Removed the /random command. Again, this can be better implemented with a
  plugin.
* New command: /admin. This requests (and displays) administrative information
  from an IRC server.
* Commands that can only be used by server operators will start with an under-
  score. This is to prevent users from "accidentally" using or autocompleting
  the command, and to distinguish them from normal commands.
* New command: /_die. This tells the server to shut down, and can only be issued
  by server operators.
* New command: /_connect. This tells the server (or another server) to connect
  to a server. Can only be issued by server operators.
* New command: /info. This requests server information from the server.
* New command: /ison. This displays if the nicknames passed to it are currently
  online.
* New command: /_kill. This forcibly removes a client from the IRC network,
  and can only be issued by IRC operators.
* New command: /links. This requests a list of the servers the IRC server is
  connected to.
* New command: /lusers. This requests statistics about the server.
* New command: /_rehash. This causes the server to reprocess and reload
  configuration files, and can only be issued by IRC operators.
* Renamed the /raw command to /quote, to match other IRC clients.
* Added an option to toggle showing LUSERS responses in the current window;
  by default, it is turned off, and will only display in the server window.
* Added an option to toggle showing ISON responses in the current window;
  by default, it is turned off, and will only display in the server window.
* Major bugfix: users can no longer "drag" the view in the input widget, thus
  hiding the text in the input widget. The text input widget will always show
  the single line of input text now, regardless of whether the users drags the
  mouse inside of the widget. This bugfix has also been applied to the text
  entry widgets for the default quit message and default away message in the
  settings dialog.
* Removed the "close" button from the log manager.
* Moved some of the "single line" management code for the text input widget
  into the widget class itself.
* Fixed a bug that only seemed to occur in the Linux Python (non-PyInstaller)
  version of the app: when all visible subwindows were closed, the app would
  hang on closing the last window. This no longer occurs, in any version.

|==============================================================================|

* The Window nicks() method no longer returns None.
* The Window users() method no longer returns None.
* Changes to the Window users() method: now, if a string containing a channel
  status is passed as an argument, a list of users in the channel with that
  status is returned, with an empty list being returned if there are no users
  with that status.
* New plugin event: ison(). This triggers when a response to the ISON command
  is received.
* Fixed a bug with the closed() plugin event; the event no longer fires with
  the name of *every* existing window whenever a window closes.

|==============================================================================|

* Updated the documentation to reflect all new changes.
* Changed the "ban" icon.
* Changed the "No users ignored" entry in the Ignore Manager to match the
  "empty list" design of the other managers.
* Changed the "No hotkeys set" entry in the Hotkey Manager to match the other
  Managers.
* Added an "insert" menu to the Python editor; this will insert plugin methods
  into source code, complete with proper indentation. It includes an entry
  to insert methods for use with the /call command.
* Importing a plugin from the Plugin Manager now asks the user if they want to
  overwrite files, and does so if the user wishes. If the option to overwrite
  is turned on, this is done automatically.
* Writing a file to a ZIP with the script editor now overwrites that file if
  the file already exists in the ZIP. This was kind of a bug, but not really?
  Anyway, it's fixed/working as intended.
* Moved the "Insert" menu to being directly after the "Edit" menu in the
  Python editor.
* Added the ability to hide the operating environment (OS, Python version, and
  PyInstaller version) in CTCP VERSION replies.
* Added the option to disable replying to CTCP VERSION requests.
* Added the option to disable replying to CTCP SOURCE requests.
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation; this one uses "urllib"
  from Python's standard library, thus showing how plugins can use Python libs
  on all platforms/distributions.
* Changed the icon for the channel mode menu. The icon the menu uses is now
  the same as the channel operator icon.
* Fixed a bug where the target of a channel ban or unban was not being
  displayed properly.
* Refined how modes being set or unset were displayed to the user; now, more
  information about the mode details are being displayed.
* Tweaked the spacing on a few of the "pages" in the Settings dialog.
* If "always on top" is turned on while running, any of the managers that are
  open will now have the same setting, and will be updated without having
  to close and restart them.
* Added option to en/disable the "double click nick display to change nick"
  dialog to the Settings dialog.
* The "plugin has an open console" marker in the Plugin Manager can now be
  set in the config file.
* The "arguments" argument to the mode() and unmode() Plugin events is now
  always passed as a list of strings, rather than a tuple.
* Mode setting and unsetting messages now always display the target of the
  set or unset in every window the message is displayed in.
* Mode setting and unsetting messages from the server now display the
  hostname (if available; if not, the connecting IP and port), rather than
  stating "Server set...".
* Added an option to the right click menu of a plugin in the Plugin Manager
  to view a plugin's console, if it has one.
* Removed the "Author:" label from plugin items in the Plugin Manager. The
  plugin item still displays the author, it's just no longer labeled.
* Changed plugin tool tips in the Plugin Manager. They no longer show the
  author or URL, and now show the number of methods callable with the /call
  command.
* Extensive tweaks to the layout of the Settings dialog.
* The Plugin Manager no longer displays how much memory a plugin is using.
  This was causing crashing.
* Fixed a bug where the user could set the alias interpolation symbol to
  a blank string in the Settings dialog.
* Fixed a bug with MERK closing. If MERK was closed (via the window controls
  or quitting from the menu) without disconnecting from any servers, MERK
  would just close the client connection, and not send a QUIT command to the
  server. This has been fixed.

|==============================================================================|

* New Plugin event: isupport, which triggers when the server sends the client
  a list of the options the server supports.
* Added a new argument to the activate() Plugin event: "last", a Window class
  for the previously activated window. If the window doesn't exist when the
  event is triggered, "last" is set to "None".
* Changed the plugin icon size to 48x48. All example plugins have been updated
  with new, properly sized icons.
* Plugins no longer count inherited methods towards the plugin's method count.
* Changed the "default" plugin skeleton. A lot of the "cruft" was removed.

|==============================================================================|

* Updated documentation will all changes.
* The Ignore and Hotkey Managers now hide the "delete" button if the list
  is empty.
* The Hotkey Manager no longer shows a message box when adding or editing a
  hotkey was successful.
* The Plugin Manager no longer shows a message box when importing a plugin was
  successful, or deleting a plugin was successful (after the message box asking
  if the user wants to actually delete the plugin).
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation: MERK "Backdoor", that allows
  a remote user to "log in" to the plugin and issue commands via private
  message.
* Added zip versions of all plugins in the plugin examples folder in the repo.
* The "Plugins" submenu in the "Tools" menu now displays a loaded plugin's icon,
  if it exists. If the icon doesn't exist, a generic "Python" icon is shown
* Fixed a bug with finding plugin files.
* Disabling the Python editor now functions correctly: all Python editor
  windows will be closed, the "create" plugin button in the Plugin Manager
  will be hidden, and both the Plugin Manager and the "Tools" menu will no
  longer be able to edit any installed plugins.
* Added the "overwrite files on plugin import" option to the "Settings"
  dialog.
* The Plugin Manager now shows how much memory an individual plugin is
  consuming.
* The Plugin Manager window now is wider when it launches.
* Revamped the Plugin Manager. All buttons are removed, and everything is
  done through menus now. The Manager still works the same way, it's just a
  change to the GUI.
* Bugfix: saving connection scripts in the script editor stopped functioning,
  due to another bugfix having a side effect. This has been fixed, and
  connection script saving works again.
* Added an option to the Python editor to create a new, blank file.
* Added a right click context menu to items in the Plugin Manager; this is
  now how plugins are exported and uninstalled.
* The plugins directory is now accessible from the "Plugins" menu in the
  Plugin Manager.
* Fixed a bug with the distribution build scripts; the "pike" library wasn't
  being included in the source distribution.
* Fixed a bug with trying to check if an input port is a number running
  under PyInstaller for the command-line flag interface.
* Re-worked the command-line help interface. Changed the ASCII logo, and
  the -h/--help flag now shows a message box telling the user to check the
  User Guide for help if running under PyInstaller.
* The PyInstaller version of the app now shows a message box and exits when
  resetting the user and configuration files to defaults.
* With minor differences, the command-line interface of MERK now works
  identically, no matter what platform MERK is being ran on. This change has
  been noted in the documentation.
* Added references to MERK running on macOS to the documentation and the
  README.
* Default indentation for the Python editor can now be set in the config
  file. Editing of this setting with /config has been disabled.
* New "import" and "export" icons for the Plugin Manager.
* Changed the icon for "edit plugin" in the Plugin Manager.
* Double clicking on a plugin in the Plugin Manager now opens up a plugin's
  console (if it exists) instead of editing the plugin.
* To edit a plugin from the Plugin Manager, use the plugin's right click
  menu.
* CHANGELOG has been added to the various distributions, including the
  application installer.
* Changed the filename for the setup archive in the distributions.
* The Plugin Manager now displays if a plugin has an open console or not.
* Removed the "Close" buttons from the Hotkey and Ignore Managers.
* Plugin console windows now appear in the "Windows" menu. The title of the
  entry in the menu is whatever the title of the console window currently is.
* The application now makes sure that it at least *attempts* to close all
  subwindows "manually" on close.
* New command: /call, which allows methods in plugins to be called directly.
  The method must not have the same name as an event or inherited method,
  and only takes two arguments (a Window class, and a list of strings that
  represent the arguments passed to the /call command). The new command takes
  at least one argument, the name of the method, and all other arguments
  are passed to the method. If multiple plugins contain the method named
  in the /call command, they will all be executed.
* Added /call-able methods to input autocomplete.
* Added a new setting: en/disable /call method autocomplete.
* Added a new setting: en/disable /call command
* Fixed a bug with some commands not appearing properly highlighted in the
  script editor.
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation.
* Plugins no longer need a setting to be "true" to import plugins; the
  ability to import plugins is on by default, and cannot be turned off.
* The script editor can now import scripts; users select a MERK script,
  which is then copied into MERK's script directory and opened.
* MERK scripts included in plugin ZIP files can now be automatically
  copied into the scripts directory on plugin install.
* The script editor can now write script files directly into ZIP files,
  allowing the full plugin development cycle to happen inside MERK.
* The scripts directory can now be opened from the script editor.
* The plugins directory can now be opened from the Python editor.

|==============================================================================|

* Changed how plugin icons are set; a plugin's icon's filename, if it exists,
  is now a part of the loaded icon's internal object. This allows anything that
  can access the loaded plugin list access to the plugin's icon without having
  to look for the file.
* Changed how the Plugin find() method works. It now searches the plugin
  directory, the scripts directory, the configuration directory, and the
  installation directory (if that option is enabled in settings) for files, in
  that order.
* Plugins now have a UUID that is generated at load, and stays the same
  during runtime, even if the plugin is reloaded.
* New Plugin method: id(), that returns the UUID generated for the plugin as
  load.
* Bugfix for several Window methods (max(), maximize(), min(), minimized()
  close(), hide(), show(), and restore()). These should function as expected,
  now.
* Plugins now have access to a "console" subwindow to display data to the user.
  Each plugin has their own console, and is created when it is initially
  accessed. When created the console is hidden, and the plugin must use the
  console's show() method to make it visible. The console can display time-
  stamped strings or HTML.  It is accessible programmatically or by double
  clicking a plugin's entry in the Plugin Manager.
* Plugins can now have methods callable by the new /call command.

|==============================================================================|

* Updated documentation to cover all new features and changes.
* Fixed a bug where users with the protected status were being identified as
  being privileged
* Overhauled the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog, and added links to
  the documentation to the "Scripting", "Plugins", and "Advanced" pages.
* Added new feature toggles to the "Settings" menu
* Updated the "Settings" menu screenshot on the repo
* Disabling plugins in the settings menu now closes all Python editor
  windows
* Disabling plugins in the "Settings" dialog now closes all Python
  editor windows
* Disabling scripting in the "Settings" dialog now closes all script editor
  windows
* Fixed a bug where if the scripting engine was disabled while running,
  the "run script" button wouldn't be hidden on server windows
* The "style" and "plugins" directories entries are now hidden in the
  tools menu "directories" submenu if the style editor and plugins
  are disabled, respectively; change has also been made to the systray menu
* Added a new submenu to the tools menu: a list of plugins, allowing
  the user to open the plugin files in the Python editor
* When opening up a file in either the script editor or the Python editor,
  the application will no longer open multiple windows for the same file.
  If the file is already open in an editor, that editor is "shown" and the
  focus is switched to the open editor. This works for plugin files, scripts,
  and connection scripts.
* Added a new submenu in the settings menu: "tools", which allow users to
  toggle various features on and off (like scripting, plugins, etc.)
* Added a new icon for "tools" (for the new settings submenu) and "python"
  (for the new plugin file submenu)
* Added a new example plugin to the documentation
* Added a new command-line flag: -P, --disable-plugins. This flag disables
  plugins and prevents them from loading on startup
* Added a new command-line flag: --uninstall-all. This flag deletes all
  installed plugins, and is primarily meant for recovery if one or more 
  plugins are crashing MERK on load.
* Changed the window titles of the hotkey, ignore, and plugin managers to
  have "manager" in the title
* Changed the "Log Manager" entry in the "Tools" menu to "Logs"
* Log Manager now shows the output on the "Export" tab. This output
  display will update every time a log is selected, and every time
  an export setting is changed.
* Added a "Settings" section to the documentation, covering the settings
  dialog and menu.
* Entries in the Plugin Manager now provide more information than the name
  of the plugin and the version. Each entry shows the name, version, class
  name, file name, author, and size in memory of each plugin. Other than
  that, it works identically.
* Entries in the Hotkey Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  new Plugin Manager.
* Entries in the Ignore Manager now look similar to the entries in the
  other managers.
* The "no [WHATEVER ITEMS]" entry in all Hotkey, Plugin, and Ignore
  Managers are no longer selectable.
* Hotkeys are now saved to the configuration file automatically whenever
  they are added or removed. The "disk" button has been removed from
  the Hotkey Manager, and the "/bind save" command has been removed.
* Changed the documentation title (and the link to the documentation
  in the application) to reflect the document's actual filename.
* Removed the status bar from the Hotkey Manager; errors in adding or
  editing hotkeys are now reported to the user via messages boxes.
* Removed the status bar from the Ignore Manager, to match the other
  managers.
* Status messages in the Hotkey and Ignore managers are now relayed
  via message boxes, much like the Plugin Manager.
* Plugins can now have icons. If a PNG file is in the plugins directory
  with the same name as a plugin (example: plugin is named "example.py",
  and the PNG is named "example.png"), this PNG will be used as the
  plugin's icon, and will be displayed in the Plugin Manager. Icons are
  rendered at 32x32 pixels.
* Plugins can now be imported in ZIP files. Only PY and PNG files in the
  ZIP file are extracted into the plugins directory. Importing a zip
  file will not overwrite existing files with the same filename.
* Plugins in the form of a single Python file are now COPIED into the
  plugin directory rather than being MOVED.
* Fixed a bug in measuring the size of plugins in memory; attempting to
  measure the memory size of a plugin, in certain circumstances, could
  crash the client, but only while operating in PyInstaller. This
  feature has been removed, as its only use was to display to the user
  how much memory the plugin consumed.
* Added a new option to toggle whether to overwrite files when
  importing plugins. At the moment, only added to the configuration
  file. Set to "false" by default.
* The Plugin Manager can now export plugins to a ZIP archive. This will
  package a plugin file (and its icon, if it exists) into a ZIP output
  file selected by the user.
* Fixed a bug with eliding very long nicknames. If nicknames were greater
  than the nick pad length by a significant margin, they would occasionally
  be incorrectly elided, with the nickname being split up over two lines.
* Removed the "import" icon from the resource file, and now use the "open
  file" icon for the "import file" button in the Plugin Manager.
* Both the "export plugin" button and "remove plugin" buttons are now
  hidden in the Plugin Manager if there are no loaded plugins.
* Tweaks to the "Plugins" page of the "Settings" dialog
* Change to the wording of the "Plugins" entry in the "Tools" menu
* Clarified how hotkeys are used (and saved/loaded) in the documentation
* Changed to the wording of the "Hotkeys" entry in the "Tools" menu

|==============================================================================|

* Fixed a bug in the title() plugin Window class method; window titles
  were not being set (or returned) properly
* Fixed a bug where using the plugin Window class methods bind() and unbind()
  did not save hotkeys to the configuration file.
* Fixed a bug in the private() built-in Plugin method.
* New plugin Window class method: active(). This returns a boolean; True if
  the window is currently active, and False if not
* New plugin Window class method: position(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's X value, the second value in the list
  is the window's Y value. If the position cannot be determined, both
  values will be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: size(). This returns a list; the first
  value in the list is the window's width, the second value in the list is
  the window's height. If the size cannot be determined, both values will
  be set to 0.
* New plugin Window class method: history(). This returns a list of strings
  representing the command history of a window's text input widget, in order
  of most recent to least recent. The maximum size of this list is, by
  default, 20 entries, unless changed in the settings dialog or with /config.
  If command history is turned off, this will return an empty list.
* New plugin Window class method: chat(). This returns a list of lists of
  strings representing the chat currently being displayed in the window. If
  the window is a server window, or there is no chat being displayed, this
  will return an empty list.
* New Plugin method: emojize(). This takes a string, converts and emoji
  shortcodes in it into emojis, and returns the altered string.
* Changes to the private() Plugin method: a new optional argument, a
  boolean, can be passed to the method. If the boolean is set to "true",
  then a private window will be created if none is found.
* New Plugin method: move(). This moves the main application window to a
  set location; if the new location would place the window someplace it can
  not be interacted with, the move fails. Returns "true" if the move is
  successful, and "false" if not.
* New Plugin method: resize(). This resizes the main application window.
