# Summary
  
**MERK** is a graphical [open source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) [Internet relay chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client. The current development version is **0.050.916**. It uses a [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface), much like the popular Windows IRC client [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/).  **MERK** is written in Python 3, using the [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) libraries, and runs on both Windows and Linux. **MERK** is updated frequently with new features and bugfixes.

**MERK** is still in development, but it works, and can be used for most IRC activities. [The current stable release of **MERK** is version 0.050.900](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/merk/releases/tag/0.050.900). **MERK** has a user guide, which can be [viewed here](./MERK_User_Guide.pdf).

Join me on the official **MERK** IRC channel, **#merk** on the Libera Chat network! Connect to  Libera in the client as one of the built-in server suggestions, or at **irc.libera.chat**, port **6667** (you can also connect via SSL on port **6697**). Honestly, I'm working a lot, so I'm almost always idle, but I pop in and chat a few times a day!

# Running MERK on Windows
**MERK** has a version built with [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) which you can run without having to install Python or any of the requirements. [You can download the current stable release (0.050.900) here](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/merk/releases/tag/0.050.900). For more information on **MERK** and how it works, [check out the user guide](./MERK_User_Guide.pdf).

To run the current development  version of **MERK**, [download this zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fnu5uasoo2dzmzwiferhw/merk-windows-latest.zip?rlkey=9fke2qid0gna4n4zt00v0uhhy&dl=1) and unzip to any directory, and double click on `merk.exe` to run the client. If you [download the installer](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0u1vcg5xuntzs2b16e01b/merk_setup.zip?rlkey=8avj1gyed3txz1nfj9ev41mmh&st=zlve4c1o&dl=1), unzip and double click on `setup.exe` to install **MERK**. You can install **MERK** any place you'd like.

If you have previously installed **MERK** and would like to update to a new version, just download the installer for the newer version and install **MERK** again; your install will be updated to the newer version. To update the `merk.exe` version, extract the [zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fnu5uasoo2dzmzwiferhw/merk-windows-latest.zip?rlkey=9fke2qid0gna4n4zt00v0uhhy&dl=1), overwriting the older version of **MERK**.

A note: all command-line arguments, as documented below, work on the all versions of **MERK**.

# Running MERK with Python

First, make sure that all the [requirements](#python-requirements) are installed. Next, [download](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pf9p7ltb3uufm5akjz7l0/merk-latest.zip?rlkey=3caodopybbcxr4p9grxygxzym&st=01zsuura&dl=1) **MERK**. Extract the zipfile to a directory of your choice using your favorite archive/zip program. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you extracted **MERK** to, and type:

    python merk.py

# Python Requirements

**MERK** requires Python 3.09+, [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). PyQt5 and Twisted can be installed by using [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pyqt5
    pip install Twisted

To connect to IRC servers via SSL, two additional libraries may be needed:

    pip install pyOpenSSL
    pip install service_identity

**MERK** is being developed with Python 3.13 on Windows 11 and Linux Mint.

If you're running Windows, and you're getting errors when trying to run **MERK**, you may have to install another library, [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/). You can also install this with [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install pywin32

To run properly on Linux, the latest version of all required software is recommended.

There are three libraries that comes bundled with **MERK**:
 - [qt5reactor 0.6.3](https://github.com/twisted/qt5reactor)
 - [pyspellchecker 0.8.3](https://github.com/barrust/pyspellchecker)
 - [emoji 2.15.0](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji)

# Example Command-line Usage
In the following examples, the first command-line is how you would do the task using **MERK** as a Python script, and second command-line is how you would do it using the **MERK** Windows executable. Note that the command-lines, other than the initial executable, are the same!

Let's assume that you want to use the command-line to connect **MERK** to the `2600.net` network and join the `#linux` channel:
```
python merk.py --channel "#linux" irc.2600.net 6667
```
```
merk.exe --channel "#linux" irc.2600.net 6667

Easy, right? Now let's try something a little more complex. Let's say you want to connect the the `Libera` network, which uses SSL/TLS. You want to use a different nickname than you normally use; you want to use the nickname `merker`, but you don't want to save this nickname as your default. When you join the network, you want to join two channels: `#python` and `#merk`:
```
python merk.py --donotsave -n merker -c "#python" -c "#merk" --ssl irc.libera.chat 6697
```
```
merk.exe --donotsave -n merker -c "#python" -c "#merk" --ssl irc.libera.chat 6697
```
You can do some things with the command-line that you can't do with the GUI. Let's say that you're using **MERK** on a computer that someone else also uses for **MERK**. You want to store your configuration files in a different folder, just for your use. You always want to use light mode, no matter what the configuration file says, and you've stored some **MERK** scripts in the `C:\Merk_Scripts` folder. You don't want **MERK** to ask you for a server to connect to, you just want it to start up, and you can choose a server from the "IRC" menu:
```
python merk.py --light --config-name .mymerk --scripts-directory "C:\Merk_Scripts" --run
```
```
merk.exe --light --config-name .mymerk --scripts-directory "C:\Merk_Scripts" --run
```
Now, let's try something that commonly done with other IRC clients: connecting to multiple servers automatically on startup. You want to use your standard settings, but connect to three different IRC servers as soon as you run **MERK**: you want to connect to the 2600 network and DALNet, using standard TCP/IP,and Libera, using SSL:
```
python merk.py -C irc.2600.net:6667 -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667
```
```
merk.exe -C irc.2600.net:6667 -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667
```
This command will start up **MERK** and connect to three of these servers without any extra effort!

You can do a lot of things from the command-line. For a really complicated example, let's try this scenario. Here's what this command-line will do:

 - Connect to Libera via SSL/TLS
 - Connect to DALnet via TCP/IP
 - Make sure that we reconnect automatically if we get disconnected from either of these servers
 - Join the `#merk` and `#python` channels on both networks
 - Make sure that we don't execute any connection scripts we have set up
 - Run in "light mode", regardless of what the configuration settings say
 - Run a **MERK** script file named `stuff.merk` on connection, for both connections

Here's the set of arguments that will make all of that happen:
```
python merk.py -Ltx -s stuff.merk -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667 -c "#python" -c "#merk"
```
```
merk.exe -Ltx -s stuff.merk -S irc.libera.chat:6697 -C us.dal.net:6667 -c "#python" -c "#merk"
```

All command-line options are what they say on the tin: _optional_. Just running the script with no command-line options will initially open up the connection dialog, and you can do just about everything completely inside the GUI.

# Why does MERK exist?
It's simple. I don't currently like any of the other IRC clients. I've used many, _many_ other IRC clients for Windows and Linux, and they just didn't feel _right_. They weren't customizable enough, didn't have features that I wanted, or just plain looked ancient. I wanted a GUI IRC client that looked and felt modern, and could be heavily customized. My previous IRC client was called [**Ərk**](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk), and although I liked developing it and working on it, I honestly didn't use it that much. I fell out of love with the "single window" interface that so many other IRC clients use, and decided to try something "new" (and by "new" I mean 30 years old). I remembered using [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) back when I was younger, and decided to try and write a new client that used the [multiple-document interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-document_interface) style I remember fondly. And thus, __MERK__ was born!

I honestly think that **MERK** may be the most configurable IRC client ever created. With over 250 different settings to work with, you can configure **MERK** to look and operate *exactly* how you want. Want to display all channel userlists on the left, or not display userlists at all? You can do that. Want to turn off all the pretty stuff, and display only raw, (nearly) unaltered text? You can do that. Maybe you want to use text styles only on the chat display, and leave the userlists and text input alone? You can do that. One of the things I hated about [XChat](http://xchat.org/)/[Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/) is how un-configurable the UI is, and how most other clients require plugins or scripts to change the client UI. I wanted a client where you could alter or change most aspects of the UI without needed external tools or editing configuration files manually. With **MERK**, you can change all settings in the client and see the effects instantly. There are a few settings that can only be changed by editing the configuration files, but they are for settings most users will probably never change; but you can still change them and **MERK** will compensate, and not break the client!

# What does MERK mean?
Well, if you were to pronounce "IRC" as a word and not an acronym, it would probably be pronounced _/Ərk/_. Since the client allows a user to connect to multiple IRC servers at the same time, well, that might be what the "M" stands for. Either that, or "multiple-document interface". "MDIIRC" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, so we combined the "M" with the word-pronunciation of IRC, and came up with __MERK__!

# Does MERK need any help?
Yes! **MERK** is being written by me, [Dan Hetrick](https://github.com/danhetrick), a software developer that can not do everything that this piece of software needs. There's few things I need help with!

 - **Icons and other graphics work**. I am not a graphic designer, and I think that that shows in this project, heh. I need help with creating better icons, and a better logo for **MERK**. I'm doing my best, here, but I'm a computer programmer, not an artist!
 - **Packaging**. **MERK** now has a [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)-based distribution! However, I can't seem to get PyInstaller working on a Linux binary for reasons that are beyond me. I'd love some help on getting packaging for Linux, be it with PyInstaller or anything else that's easy for end-users to use. I also know next to nothing about making Python packages for use with  `pip`, but that's another thing I'd love help with!
 - **DCC chat and file transfers**. The DCC  functionality in Twisted is undocumented, and I'll be honest, I can't make heads or tails of it. I'd love to be able to add this functionality to **MERK**, but I need help!
 - **Using MERK and giving me feedback**. Let me know what you love about **MERK** and what you hate about **MERK**! Got ideas for ways you'd like to customize the client? Features you'd like? Let me know! I can't guarantee that I'll put in everything that you want, but I love hearing new ideas, and I love hearing about how people are using **MERK**!

Contacting me is easy! Drop me an [email](mailto:dhetrick@gmail.com) or say hi in the official **MERK** IRC channel: `#merk` on the Libera network (`irc.libera.chat`, port 6667 for TCP/IP and port 6697 for SSL). I work a lot, so I'm not always active, but I idle in `#merk` everyday, and pop in to talk to people when I have a spare minute.
